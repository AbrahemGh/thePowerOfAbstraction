Modify the Java program in Assignment #7 so that it gets the input from the command line. i.e.
java MyClass 10 à it means that print(int x) will be invoked
java MyClass Hello à it means that print (String x) will be invoked
and so on….
If the number of command line arguments is more than 3 or not matching one of the print
methods, then print a message to the user that “Input is Wrong”
