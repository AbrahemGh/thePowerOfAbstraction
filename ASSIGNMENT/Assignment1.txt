Define a new class called "Person". Modify your "Person" class to add a constructor. Make the
constructor output the text "Constructor running!". Modify the Person class so that it has another
constructor, in addition to the constructor it's already got. Make this second constructor accept a
parameter called name of type String. Make this second constructor print the name parameter
using System.out.println(). Modify your Person class so that it has a private instance variable
called name of type String. In your second constructor, set the value of the "name" instance
variable using the "name" parameter that you pass in. Remove the System.out.println()'s from the
Person class. Methods are a way of making subroutines part of objects (by defining them in
classes of course). Add a method to your Person class called "writeName". Make this method
output the text "My name is " followed by the value of the name instance variable. Invoke (in
other words run or call) this method in your main method. n prehistoric times, get and set
methods (also known as getters and setters) were known as mutators and accessors. Add
getName and setName methods to your class. Modify your main method to use getters and
setters.
